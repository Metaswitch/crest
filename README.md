Crest
==============

Overview
--------
Crest is a RESTful CRUD server built using Python on top of Cassandra. It is designed to
be easily extensible and makes some assumptions about how you'll want to store your data 
in Cassandra.

In Clearwater, Crest is used to power the Homer and Homestead-prov components. See the documentation for these
projects for more details. The common features and instructions for both are listed in this file.
